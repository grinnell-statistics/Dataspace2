		<h2> Part 2: Key predictors explaining Brexit: Age, Education and Socioeconomic Index</h2>
	<p> The British Election Study alows for an examination of the key predictors explaining attutudes towards Brexit. One of the key assumptions examined here is that Brexit debates and voting had some constituencies more engaged with the process than others. The British elder population was more likey to embrace Brexit than younger cohorts.
		</p>
	  <!--<img src = "nypd/Picture2.jpg" alt = "Police" width = "100%">-->
	  <!--<p style = "color:grey"> Figure 2: A significant majority of the younger British voters wanted to "remain in the EU".</p>-->
	  <h2 style="font:bold;font-size:20px; padding-right: 30px"><strong>Explore the data:</strong></h2> <p style="font-size:18px">Use the app below to explore the data on your own. Then modify the graph to answer the questions on the right.</p>
	  <iframe src = "https://shiny.grinnell.edu/BrexitApp2/" width="800px" height="750px" style = "border:none"  ></iframe>
	<p>
	The incentives for younger votes to remain in the EU were mostly strategic. The number one incentive for younger voters was to stay in the EU because of the freedom of movement. Movement within the EU allowed them to examine and explore other labor markets. Interestingly, while Brexit constrained the options of the younger cohorts of voter, many British elder residents in Southern Europe were also affected by the Brexit vote. Many were not able to benefit from access to services regulated under the EU agreements (like their ability to access health care).
	</p>
	  <p>
		A second major predictor explaining the attitudes towards Brexit was the respondents levels of education. Highly educated individuals were more likely to be in favor of Brexit than individuals with lower levels of education. One possible explaination might be related to their overall level of knowledge of the benefits of membership. The campaign run by the pro-Brexit forces were notorious for fabricating data related to alleged impacts of certain regulations forcely imposed on the UK by the European Union.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		A third major predictor explaining the attitudes towards Brexit was the respondents' socieconomic status. Wealthier voters are more likely to have experienced the benefits of free movement than less wealthy voters. 
		</p>
    <p>
		<strong>
			KEY IDEA: 
		</strong>
		Data was significantly distinct for Scotland compared to other nations within the United Kingdom (Wales and England). Using the interactive app produce three data visualizations that measure the relationship between age and brexit; education and Brexit vote and Socioeconomic index and Brexit vote.
