      <h3> Part 1A: Introduction</h3>
      <p>Have you ever felt that you have a special ability to know something is true just through intuition? For
        example, have you ever played a casino game where you won because you correctly guessed the throw of the dice,
        the right card, or the color on a roulette wheel? If someone wins several times in a row, do they have special
        skills or are they just lucky? The Psychic Test below will evaluate your ability to predict the right card.
      </p>

      <h3> Part 1B: The Psychic Test</h3>
      <p>
        Here are some key terms that will be recorded during the test:
      </p>
      <li>
        The game will ask you for a <strong>Player ID</strong>. You can use any name you like, but this will be on the
        internet. Use a code name that you will remember, but do not use a name that will easily identify you.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are playing this game for a course, your instructor will provide a <strong>Group ID</strong> so you can
        compete with everyone in your class.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <strong>Play</strong> button and see how many times you can correctly guess the right card.
      </li>
      <p>
        Your <strong>goal</strong> is to correctly guess which of the 5 cards will be selected. In this initial test,
        you will have 10 attempts, each with 5 cards. The number of attempts that you correctly guess will be
        automatically saved.

        <h3> 1C: Designing a Coaster</h3>

        <p>
          When designing your first roller coaster, you will create up to three functions, that when combined, will
          represent a roller coaster path that is continuous and differentiable. This means the track (the combination
          of
          all three functions) must flow smoothly without any breaks or sharp turns. You'll need to submit the
          following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The functions that represent the track.
          </li>
          <li>
            Calculations showing how the track is continuous and differentiable at the points where the three functions
            connect.
          </li>
          <li>
            A screenshot of your coaster design and your final score.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>
            You can build and visualize your coaster here:

          Here are some key terms that will be recorded during the coaster game:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The game will ask you for a Player ID. You can use any name you like, but this will be on the internet. Use
            a
            code name that you will remember, but do not use a name that will easily identify you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the Group ID : friend
          </li>

          <li>
            Click the Play button and enter your roller coaster functions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your <strong>goal</strong> is to enter a smooth and continuous function that represent the most exciting
          roller
          coaster possible. The final score represents the level of excitement which is measured by the total changes in
          elevation of your coaster.

          <h3>1D: Example <img src="images/Challenge.jpg" width="35" height="38" alt="challenge icon" /></h3>
          <p>In the image to the left, we have created a simple roller coaster.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The first function (the green line) shows the lift ramp of a roller coaster. Here we entered a simple linear
              function (y = 5 +1x). At the start of the roller coaster (x = 0), people would load at a height of y = 5.
              Typically, a coaster will have some type of conveyor to get you to the top of the coaster, then gravity will
              carry you through the rest of the coaster.
            </li>
            <li>
              The equation entries require that the ending x value of the first equation is the starting value of the next
              equation. This ensures that there are no horizontal gaps in the coaster.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Graph and Math Check buttons allow us to verify that the coaster will work. To be continuous the y value
              of the first function when x = 20 must equal the y value of the second function when x = 20. This ensures that
              there are no vertical gaps in the coaster.
            </li>
            <li>
              The second function is quadratic, allowing the coaster to have a smooth curve. If two linear equations are put
              next to each other, the graph would have a sharp V-shaped curve, meaning that it would not be differentiable
              (and not safe to ride).
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to be differentiable the slope of the first line and the slope of the second line must also be equal
              at x = 20.
            </li>
            <li>
              Here the second and third functions are the same (except for the x-axis), this is not necessary, just two
              equations could be listed and the cells in the last row can all be blank. To get more points, more curves are
              needed.
            </li>
          </ol>
    
          <p>
            In this version of the game, there are some restrictions:
          </p>
    
          <ol>
            <li>
              You can enter 1, 2, or 3 functions.
            </li>
    
            <li>
              The x-axis must go from 0 to 50
            </li>
            <li>
              The height of the coaster must always be greater than 0
            </li>
            <li>
              Before building your coaster, you should use the Math Check button to ensure that your functions are
              continuous and differentiable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your score, which is based on elevation changes, only starts after your coaster starts changing direction. In
              other words, if you just draw a straight line that only goes up, your score will be 0.
            </li>
          </ol>

        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
          <li>1.7 Evaluate your class scores. Sometimes it can take up to 60 minutes for your class data to show in the
            App, <a href="https://shiny.grinnell.edu/psychic1/">here</a>. After your instructor confirms enough class
            data is available, answer the following questions:
            <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
              <li>In the App above, use the GroupID assigned to your class. Use the summary statistics button to
                identify the mean, median, and sample size of your class data.</li>
              <li>Compare the histogram of your class data to the histogram when we use “all” as the Group ID. Are
                the center, variability, and shape similar?</li>
              <li>What was the best score in your class? If there are 20 people in your class (20 games played),
                would you be surprised if one person got a “psychic” result by getting 5 or more correct? Explain your
                reasoning.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>1.8 How does the number of cards influence our results? Take another psychic test, <a
              href="https://www.stat2games.sites.grinnell.edu/games/psychic.html">here</a>, with 10 attempts. However,
            in this new test click the options tab to select 2 cards per attempt instead of 5 cards per attempt.
            <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
              <li>In the first game, the probability of success was 1/5 = 0.2. What is the probability of success
                when there are 2 cards per attempt?</li>
              <li>When you have 10 attempts, with 2 cards each, how many successes would you expect to get?</li>
              <li>Use the App above to estimate how many successes would be needed before the result might be
                considered unusual.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>1.9 In 2019, USA Today published an article discussing two marine lab manatees (Buffet and Hugh)
            attempting to predict the Super Bowl winner. Watch the video <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDUet_DD6q4">here</a>. Each manatee had a 50% chance of selecting
            the winner.
            <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
              <li>Buffett had correctly picked 9 winners from 2008-2018, while Hugh had only picked 6 winners. Does
                this mean you should expect Buffett to be better at predicting the winner of the 2019 Super Bowl?</li>
              <li>Use the App above to estimate how likely it is to get 9 out of 11 attempts correct. Since the
                Psychic game doesn’t allow us to play with 11 attempts, click the binomial distribution option under
                Histograms for a more accurate estimate.</li>
              <li>The USA Today article also lists other animals predicting the Super Bowl, such as Fiona the Hippo,
                Kiki the Lioness, and April the Giraffe. When thousands of animals are used to predict the Super Bowl,
                explain why it is NOT surprising for a few to be correct often.</li>

          <li>1.10 Your friend Eli claims he can tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi. However, you are skeptical.
            You design a test where Eli guesses between two cups, each containing one drink, repeated 10 times.
            <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
              <li>State the null and alternative hypotheses.</li>
              <li>If the null hypothesis is true, would you be surprised if Eli got 7 out of 10 correct? Use the App
                to explain your reasoning.</li>
              <li>In this test, Eli got 9 out of 10 correct. Use the App to find the p-value for this test. Based on
                this p-value, explain whether or not you have strong evidence to support the idea that Eli can taste the
                difference between the two. </li>

          <li>1.11 How does the number of attempts (or sample size) influence our conclusions? Use the App to find the
            following probabilities for the psychic game. For this question, we may not have enough psychic game data,
            so use the binomial distribution option to get a more reliable histogram and probability.
            <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
              <li>With 5 cards and 10 attempts, how likely is it for a player to get 40% or more correct (4 or more
                out of 10 correct guesses)?</li>
              <li>With 5 cards and 20 attempts, how likely is it for a player to get 40% or more correct (8 or more
                out of 20 correct guesses)?</li>
              <li>With 5 cards and 50 attempts, how likely is it for a player to get 40% or more correct (20 or more
                out of 50 correct guesses)?</li>
              <li>Explain the pattern you see from Questions 1.11a – 1.11c. Why would you expect a larger number of
                attempts to influence the probability of getting 40% or more.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>1.12 In 2016, the American Statistical Association posted a statement to address the many misconceptions
            and misuses of the p-value in published research.
            <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
              <li>The first principle described in this statement says, “P-values can indicate how incompatible the
                data are with a specified statistical model.” Use the Pepsi-Coke example (Question 1.10) to explain how
                a small p-value provides evidence against the null hypothesis (where our statistical model assumed p =
                0.5).</li>
              <li>The second principle states, “P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis
                is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone.” Use the Pepsi-Coke
                example (Question 1.10) to explain how a p-value larger than 0.10 does not prove Eli has no ability to
                differentiate between the two colas.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>1.13 In the App we see that over 10,000 games have been played the original psychic game, using 5 cards
            and 10 attempts.
            <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
              <li>Estimate the proportion of all the games played that have scores of 5 or more.</li>
              <li>If there are 100 students in your class, how many would you expect to get a score of 5 or more
                (while assuming the null hypothesis is true)?</li>
              <li>If there are 40 students in your class who played the original psychic game, explain why it would
                not be surprising for at least one student to get a score that leads to a p-value < 0.05, even when no
                  one in the class has psychic abilities.</li>
              <li>Explain why it is not appropriate for someone to play the original psychic game 100 times and then
                use only their best score to “show evidence” that they are psychic.</li>
              <li>Terms such as p-hacking, data dredging, data fishing, or data snooping can all be used to describe
                when data is manipulated to create hypothesis tests with small p-values, when there are no meaningful
                conclusions. Tyler Vigen has created a website <a
                  href="https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations">here</a> that demonstrates one type of data
                manipulation focusing on the “multiple comparison problem.” In essence, this means a researcher conducts
                numerous hypothesis tests, then publishes only the tests with small p-values. Choose one graph from
                Tyler Vigen’s site and explain how this is an example of p-hacking.</li>
