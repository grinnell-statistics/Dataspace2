        <h3> Introduction</h3>

        <p> In this lab, your goal is to complete a research study based on the Racer game. Each car you select can be
          raced multiple times on a track and the time to complete each race will be recorded. After you race the cars,
          the data will be available for you to analyze. </p>

        <h3> 3A: Designing an Experiment </h3>
        <p> Many people assume that statistics focuses on calculations. However, most real-world projects spend much
          more time properly collecting data (or cleaning/organizing data) than they do on the calculations. For
          example, before collecting any data for an experiment involving the Racer game, the following steps should be
          addressed: </p>
        <p> </p>

        <ol>
          <li> <strong> Develop a hypothesis</strong> about the population of all races. Here are a few examples:</li>
          <dd>• I believe that on average, Bayes car is faster than the Gauss Car</dd>
          <dd>• I believe that on average, the Gauss car will complete a race faster than the Nightingale car.</dd>
          <dd>• I believe that at least one of the average Finish Times is different for the Bayes, Gauss, or
            Nightingale cars.</dd>
          <li> Determine how you will <strong> collect your sample</strong></li>
          <dd>• What will you consider as an observation? For example, will it be a player, an individual race, a pair
            of races, a car, or a track?</dd>
          <dd>• How many samples will you collect?</dd>
          <dd>• What is the explanatory variable? Is it categorical or quantitative?</dd>
          <dd>• What is the response variable? Is it categorical or quantitative?</dd>
          <dd>• How will randomization be incorporated into the data collection?</dd>
          <dd>• What specific data needs to be recorded with each race?</dd>
          <dd>• What graphs or statistical methods do you plan to use once you collect the data? In the example below,
            we discuss using a paired t-test.</dd>
          <li><strong>Identify potential confounding variables.</strong> In order to evaluate whether the car speeds are
            truly different, we should take into account possible <strong>confounding variables</strong> (variables that
            the researcher did not include in the study but that might be connected to both the independent variable and
            the dependent variable). For example, some racetracks are longer than others. We want to hold the track
            constant for everyone in your experiment to ensure that the type of track does not bias our results. Are
            there any other potential confounding variables that might get in the way of determining which car is
            faster? </li>
        </ol>

        <p></p>
        <hr>

        <h3> 3B: Collecting Data </h3>
        <p> Researchers need clear protocols (instructions) so that the experimental data is collected using the same
          process every time. Documentation of these protocols also enables other researchers to verify the validity of
          the data. If collecting data as a class, clearly identify the exact protocols (instructions) and timeframe for
          collecting data. For example, here are the protocols for data collected in an earlier class: </p>

        <section class="6u" style="width:90%;color:black;font-size: 18px">
          <li><a>All data was collected during class time on a computer in the statistics lab room.</a></li>
          <li><a>Students logged onto the site and went to the Racer game.</a></li>
          <li><a>Make sure you enter the correct&nbsp; <em><strong>GroupID </strong> and
                <strong>PlayerID</strong></em>.</a></li>
          <li><a>Click the &nbsp;<em><strong>Paired Test</strong></em>&nbsp; button on the main menu.</a></li>
          <li><a>Each student in the class will race exactly two times on the <em><strong>Oval Track</strong></em>.
              Prior to racing the cars, students were randomly assigned which car they would race first.</a></li>
          <li><a>Use the &nbsp;<em><strong>pull down menu to select which car you will race first</strong></em>.</a>
          </li>
          <li><a>Then select &nbsp;<em><strong>which car you will race second</strong></em>.</a></li>
          <li><a>Then select the &nbsp;<em><strong>Track</strong>.</em></a></li>
          <li><a>Then click the &nbsp;<em><strong>Continue &nbsp;</strong></em>button.</a></li>
          <li><a>Use the arrow keys to race the car. </a></li>
        </section>
    </section>

      </p>
      <h3> 3C: Examining the Data</h3>

      <p> Before conducting any calculations, it is essential to examine your data. For example, the following questions
        should be asked for any data that was collected in the Racer game.</p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Were there any players who did not properly follow instructions? Did they play the game an incorrect number
          of times? Did they use the wrong cars or tracks? Can their data be included? </li>
        <li>Were there any outliers or skewed data? How does this influence our analysis? Should these outliers be
          removed?
        </li>
        <li>How can we account for player skill level? </li>
        <li>How do we account for the influence of order in which cars are raced? For example, would you expect players
          to perform better after practicing with the first car?</li>
        <li>How does the variation in effect size (the difference between means) compare to the random variation in our
          data?</li>
        <li>Are there any other issues that may cause our data to be unreliable or invalid?</li>
        <li>What conditions are required to conduct a statistical analysis? How can you evaluate whether these
          conditions were met. If the sample size is small, it is particularly important to verify that the conditions
          are satisfied. What should you do if the needed conditions are not met? </li>

      </ol>

      Watch the following video to see an example of how data cleaning can influence a statistical analysis.

      <h3> 3D: Analyzing the Data</h3>
      <p>Before we analyze the data your class has collected, we will first look at a sample dataset, called
        <strong>sample2</strong>. Complete the questions on the left to make sure you understand how this app works,
        then analyze your class data. </p>
      <hr>
      <p> To use the app below, start with the following settings then answer the questions to the left.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <li> Group ID: <strong>sample2</strong></li>
      <li> X Variable: <strong>Body</strong></li>
      <li> Y Variable: <strong>Finish Time</strong></li>
      <li> Check: <strong>Add Boxplot</strong></li>
