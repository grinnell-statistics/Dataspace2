		<h3> Part 3 Introduction</h3>
        <p>Imagine playing a card game with a friend. In the game there are 5 cards in front of you and your friend in his mind chooses one of them. Your task is to use your psychic abilities to guess which one it is, and then select it. If you get it correctly, then you get a point. The game goes for 25 rounds and in the end your score is calculated. You don’t believe in psychic abilities, but your friend just got 15 out of 25 correctly, compared to you with only 5 guessed. You may say it is luck, someone else may say that the friend is actually psychic, and you are too grumpy to admit that. To see what is the truth you may want to calculate the p-value that will determine what is the probability of the friend getting this high score if he is a regular, non-psychic player. However, before getting more into the topic of p-value, let’s spend a minute discussing hypothesis testing, which always goes together with our p-value.</p>
		<br>
		<p>When reading about p-values you will encounter the name of “hypothesis testing”, that is a method used to decide if the data we work with supports an event we are interested in. In hypothesis testing there are two of these events called  “null hypothesis” and “alternative hypothesis”, that contradict themselves, which is why only one can be true. The null hypothesis, as the name suggests, is a status quo, and hypothesizes that there is no difference. On the other hand, the alternative hypothesis proposes a change, a difference.</p>
		<br>
		<p>For example, if discussing the harmfulness of smoking, the null hypothesis would state that it does not lower life expectancy, while the alternative hypothesis would say the contrary – that it indeed does lower it. Or for the case of psychic game:</p>
			<li>Null Hypothesis (H₀): The friend that got a high score in the game was just lucky</li>
			<li>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The friend that got a high score in the game is actually psychic</li>
		<p>In order to evaluate which one is true we need to calculate the p-value, that is a number between 0 and 1. The higher the value the higher the probability of a certain result if the null hypothesis is true. In our example, the p-value is the probability of the friend who is a normal player (just lucky) to get a score that is as high as that of someone who is actually psychic. You can probably see that in order to determine that the friend is psychic, we would like this probability to be as low as possible. The lower it is, the lower the probability that he is just an average player who got lucky. The standard used in the scientific world as a cut-off p-value is 0.05. That means that we consider p-value of 0.05 to be low enough to “reject the null hypothesis” and “support alternative hypothesis” i.e. have evidence that the friend is psychic. However, if the number is higher than 0.05, we “fail to reject the null hypothesis” and “cannot support alternative hypothesis”, as we simply cannot tell if the friend is psychic or just got lucky.</p>
		<p>Let's get to it in practise!</p>
		<br>
		<h3> Game Introduction</h3>
		<dd>
		<p>The Psychic game tests your psychic abilities to guess which of the presented cards is the correct one</p>
        <p>Before the game begins, you will be asked to select:</p>
			<li>The number of attempts (rounds) </li>
        
     	   <li>The number of cards you would like to play with (the cards you will be guessing from)</li>
        
		<p>The standard is 25 rounds and 5 cards.</p>
        
        <p>Your <strong>goal</strong> is to correctly guess each card as the rounds progress.&nbsp; </p>
        
                
        <p> Here are some key terms that will be recorded during the test:</p>
		<dd>
		<li>
		The game will ask you for a <strong>Player ID</strong>. You can use any name you like, but this will be on the internet, so do not use a name that will easily identify you.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		If you are playing this game for a course, your instructor will provide a <strong>Group ID</strong> so you will be able to compete with everyone in your class.
		</li>
		</dd>

		<h3>1A: Taking the Pyschic Test</h3>

	<h3> 1B: Collecting Data</h3>
    
    <p>The Psychic Game is intended to show that event when using the benchmark of p-value of 0.05, we are likely to get false-positive results. Such false-positives ocurr when we think that the result of the study is statistically significant while it actually is just "lucky". While playing the game pay attention to the p-value of the scores you get and notice how it fluctuates across the games you play. How does it compare to the average? How close it is to the games of the highest-scoring students in your group?</p>

                                <br>
                                <ol>
                                a) Provide the same Player ID
                                <br>
                                b) Add a “c” at the end of your Group ID. For example, if your Group ID was Stat101S22, now use Stat101S22c
                                <br>
                                c) Select Level 1

                                d) Select only the corn crop.
								<br>
								e) Choose any amounts of water and any number of plots.
                            
                            </ol>
                            </ol>
				<p>After playing one season, submit your Player ID, Income, Expenses, and Profits to your instructor. Compare your profits with those of your fellow students by entering your new Group ID below. Sometimes it can take up to 60 minutes for your class data to show in the app below.</p>

            <p><strong>Evaluating a linear model: Use Settings A in Greenhouse App1</strong></p>
				<ol>3. Based on the linear model created in App 1 to address the following questions:
					<br>
					<ol>
						a) Notice that the yields vary, even when the same amount of water is used. Explain why this should be expected. 
						<br>	
						b) Modify the <strong>X Axis Limits</strong>. When is a linear model a good fit for this data? When is a linear model a poor fit for this data? Briefly explain how you distinguish a good fit from a poor fit.
             			<br>
						c) If modifying the range of the data improves the linear model, would it be appropriate to remove some of our data? Why or why not?<br>
					</ol>

				</ol>
                
                <p><strong>Evaluating class data: Use Settings B in the Greenhouse App1</strong></p>
						<ol>4. Sometimes it can take up to 60 minutes for your class data to show in Greenhouse App1. After your instructor confirms enough class data is available, answer the following questions.
                        <ol>
                            a) What is the explanatory variable and response variable for this data?
                            <br>
                            b) What are the units (what does each point represent)?
                            <br>
                            c) Does it look as though all the players followed the instructions in Step 1B? Explain why or why not.
                            <br>
                            d) Do the results from your class agree with the sample1 data? Explain why or why not.
                            <br>
                            e) Try some different statistical models. Which one looks like it best describes the data?
                            <br>
                            f) What conclusions can you draw from this data and the corresponding regression model?
                        </ol>
                        </ol>
                        

								
							</ol> 
						<ol>5. Address the following questions about different ways we could have conducted this study to improve the quality of our data:
							<br>
							<ol>
								a) Are there better variables to use? For example, what would be the benefits to using <em>Profit</em> or <em>Revenue</em> as the response variable instead of <em>Yield</em>? 
								<br>
								b)	What are the benefits to randomizing the amount of water assigned to each plot?
								<br>
								c) How many plots would need to be tested to convince you that there is a relationship between <em>Water</em> and <em>Yield</em>?
							</ol>
                        </ol>
                        
                        
                        <ol>6. In order to create a meaningful regression model, we should take into account possible <strong>confounding variables</strong> [variables that the researcher did not include in the study but that might be connected to both the explanatory (independent) variable and the response (dependent) variable]. List at least two potential confounding variables that might get in the way of determining the relationship between Water and Yield.</ol>
                        
                        <ol>7. Go back to the Greenhouse App1, use Group ID = <strong>sample1</strong> and Y Variable = <strong>Profit,</strong> then create a linear model.
                            <br>
							<ol>
							a) Explain why the linear model does not work as well for profit as it did for yield.
							<br>
							b) Based on this graph, what amount(s) of water should be used to get the most yield?
							<br>
                            c) Create a graph and write a paragraph clearly explaining to a farmer the best strategy to maximize corn profits in one season.
