      <h3> Part 1A: Introduction</h3>
      <p>Have you ever felt that you have a special ability to know something is true just through intuition? For
        example, have you ever played a casino game where you won because you correctly guessed the throw of the dice,
        the right card, or the color on a roulette wheel? If someone wins several times in a row, do they have special
        skills or are they just lucky? The Psychic Test below will evaluate your ability to predict the right card.
      </p>

      <h3> Part 1B: The Psychic Test</h3>
      <p>
        Here are some key terms that will be recorded during the test:
      </p>
      <li>
        The game will ask you for a <strong>Player ID</strong>. You can use any name you like, but this will be on the
        internet. Use a code name that you will remember, but do not use a name that will easily identify you.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are playing this game for a course, your instructor will provide a <strong>Group ID</strong> so you can
        compete with everyone in your class.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <strong>Play</strong> button and see how many times you can correctly guess the right card.
      </li>
      <p>
        Your <strong>goal</strong> is to correctly guess which of the 5 cards will be selected. In this initial test,
        you will have 10 attempts, each with 5 cards. The number of attempts that you correctly guess will be
        automatically saved.
      </p>

        <h3> Part 1C: Exploring Example Data</h3>

        <p>How well did you do at guessing the right cards? Before we come to any conclusions about psychic abilities,
          we should carefully consider
          several questions. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How many does the average person, with no special abilities, get right?</li>
          <li>How many would you need to correctly guess before we started to suspect there was something more going on
            than random guessing?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before we analyze your data, let's look at a sample dataset from a previous class of students, <a
            href="https://shiny.grinnell.edu/psychic1/">this
            dataset</a>. Before answering any of the questions, make sure the settings in the app look like the image
          below.</p>

        <h3>Part 1D: Hypothesis Testing and p-values <img src="images/Challenge.jpg" width="35" height="38"
            alt="challenge icon" /></h3>

        <p>The above activity can be used to explain the core ideas behind statistical hypothesis tests. Hypothesis
          testing is a process used to determine
          whether an event can reasonably be attributed to chance or whether there is some other explanation. </p>
        <p>For example, let’s assume your friend, Akilah, claims to be psychic and you decide to test this claim using a
          test similar to the one above. There are
          two possible conclusions we can make.</p>

        <li>Claim 1: Akilah has no special ability to predict the right card. Then we would expect that Akilah would
          typically get 1 out of 5 guesses correct.
          This would also be equivalent to saying the probability of success is 0.2. Statisticians write this as a null
          hypothesis: Ho: p = 0.2.
          Null hypotheses are typically what we assume before we collect any data. Here we use “p” to represent the
          assumed proportion.</li>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> In every null hypothesis we are making several corresponding assumptions. It is
            important to identify these assumptions
            before any test can be trusted. In this test, Claim 1 is also assuming:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The above Psychic Test is truly random. We assume that this test is not manipulated in a way that allows
              people to be more likely to guess the
              right card correctly.</li>
            <li>Akilah is only playing one game. In other words, we are collecting one sample of data with 10
              observations (10 attempts). Akilah did not play
              the game multiple times and only her best score was shown.</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <li>Claim 2: At least one of the assumptions in the null hypothesis is incorrect, meaning Akilah is expected to
          do better than 1 out of 5 correct guesses. This
          would also be equivalent to saying the probability of success is greater than 0.2. Statisticians write this as
          an alternative hypothesis: Ha: p > 0.2.</li>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to recognize that one hypothesis test, by itself, should never be
            enough to prove a theory, but it can be used to
            determine how much evidence there is to support a theory. * [[See the American Statistical Association
            statement to see more details behind these ideas,
            https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/p-valuestatement.pdf]] </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Based on the data visualization in Part 1C, we can make conclusions based on Akilah’s score.</p>

        <li>Case 1): Let’s assume Akilah played your game and got 4 out of 10 correct, she would have done better than
          expected. However, the above app shows us that 12% of
          the time people can get 4 or more correct just by chance. In terms of our statistical hypothesis test, the
          p-value = 0.12 does not give evidence to believe Akilah
          does better than the average person with no abilities. Thus the sample data (Akilah’s score) provides no
          evidence to support the idea that Claim 2 is true. </li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A p-value is a number between 0 and 1 that we use to quantify our decision. A p-value is the probability of
            observing an outcome while
            assuming that the null hypothesis and all corresponding assumptions are true. </p>
          <p>In a hypothesis test, “no evidence” or "weak evidence" is typically associated with a large p-value
            (greater than 0.05), "moderate
            evidence" might fall in a range between 0.05 and 0.1, and "very strong evidence" would be a very small
            p-value (such as 0.01 or
            lower) signifying a highly significant result against the null hypothesis. </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The p-value is not the same as the p we use in our null and alternative hypotheses. </p>

        <li>CASE 2) Let’s assume Akilah got 6 out of 10 guesses correct. If the null hypothesis is true (p = 0.2) the
          probability that Akilah correctly guesses 6 or
          more cards is 0.01. This may cause us to question the null hypothesis and conclude that something is helping
          Akilah correctly guess the cards (at least one of the assumptions in the null hypothesis is incorrect. </li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A p-value = 0.01 provides very strong evidence against the null hypothesis, meaning that it is unlikely,
            but not impossible, that someone will correctly guess 6 or more cards just by random chance. However,
            p-values
            never prove that our alternative hypothesis is true; it simply tells us how unlikely the null hypothesis is
            when only chance is involved. </p>
          <p>Even if Case 2 is true, one hypothesis test does not prove Akilah has special abilities. Instead, we should
            say, “The observed data provides some evidence that leads us to question the null hypothesis.” The questions
            below discuss additional questions to consider when conducting hypothesis tests.</p>

          <li>1.7 Evaluate your class scores. Sometimes it can take up to 60 minutes for your class data to show in the
            App, <a href="https://shiny.grinnell.edu/psychic1/">here</a>. After your instructor confirms enough class
            data is available, answer the following questions:
            <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
              <li>In the App above, use the GroupID assigned to your class. Use the summary statistics button to
                identify the mean, median, and sample size of your class data.</li>
              <li>Compare the histogram of your class data to the histogram when we use “all” as the Group ID. Are
                the center, variability, and shape similar?</li>
              <li>What was the best score in your class? If there are 20 people in your class (20 games played),
                would you be surprised if one person got a “psychic” result by getting 5 or more correct? Explain your
                reasoning.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>1.8 How does the number of cards influence our results? Take another psychic test, <a
              href="https://www.stat2games.sites.grinnell.edu/games/psychic.html">here</a>, with 10 attempts. However,
            in this new test click the options tab to select 2 cards per attempt instead of 5 cards per attempt.
            <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
              <li>In the first game, the probability of success was 1/5 = 0.2. What is the probability of success
                when there are 2 cards per attempt?</li>
              <li>When you have 10 attempts, with 2 cards each, how many successes would you expect to get?</li>
              <li>Use the App above to estimate how many successes would be needed before the result might be
                considered unusual.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>1.9 In 2019, USA Today published an article discussing two marine lab manatees (Buffet and Hugh)
            attempting to predict the Super Bowl winner. Watch the video <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDUet_DD6q4">here</a>. Each manatee had a 50% chance of selecting
            the winner.
            <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
              <li>Buffett had correctly picked 9 winners from 2008-2018, while Hugh had only picked 6 winners. Does
                this mean you should expect Buffett to be better at predicting the winner of the 2019 Super Bowl?</li>
              <li>Use the App above to estimate how likely it is to get 9 out of 11 attempts correct. Since the
                Psychic game doesn’t allow us to play with 11 attempts, click the binomial distribution option under
                Histograms for a more accurate estimate.</li>
              <li>The USA Today article also lists other animals predicting the Super Bowl, such as Fiona the Hippo,
                Kiki the Lioness, and April the Giraffe. When thousands of animals are used to predict the Super Bowl,
                explain why it is NOT surprising for a few to be correct often.</li>

            <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
              <li>State the null and alternative hypotheses.</li>
              <li>If the null hypothesis is true, would you be surprised if Eli got 7 out of 10 correct? Use the App

              <li>In this test, Eli got 9 out of 10 correct. Use the App to find the p-value for this test. Based on
                this p-value, explain whether or not you have strong evidence to support the idea that Eli can taste the
                difference between the two. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>1.11 How does the number of attempts (or sample size) influence our conclusions? Use the App to find the
            following probabilities for the psychic game. For this question, we may not have enough psychic game data,
            so use the binomial distribution option to get a more reliable histogram and probability.
            <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
              <li>With 5 cards and 10 attempts, how likely is it for a player to get 40% or more correct (4 or more
                out of 10 correct guesses)?</li>
              <li>With 5 cards and 20 attempts, how likely is it for a player to get 40% or more correct (8 or more
                out of 20 correct guesses)?</li>
              <li>With 5 cards and 50 attempts, how likely is it for a player to get 40% or more correct (20 or more
                out of 50 correct guesses)?</li>
              <li>Explain the pattern you see from Questions 1.11a – 1.11c. Why would you expect a larger number of
                attempts to influence the probability of getting 40% or more.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>1.12 In 2016, the American Statistical Association posted a statement to address the many misconceptions
            and misuses of the p-value in published research.
            <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
              <li>The first principle described in this statement says, “P-values can indicate how incompatible the
                data are with a specified statistical model.” Use the Pepsi-Coke example (Question 1.10) to explain how
                a small p-value provides evidence against the null hypothesis (where our statistical model assumed p =
                0.5).</li>
              <li>The second principle states, “P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis
                is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone.” Use the Pepsi-Coke
                example (Question 1.10) to explain how a p-value larger than 0.10 does not prove Eli has no ability to
                differentiate between the two colas.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>1.13 In the App we see that over 10,000 games have been played the original psychic game, using 5 cards
            and 10 attempts.
            <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
              <li>Estimate the proportion of all the games played that have scores of 5 or more.</li>
              <li>If there are 100 students in your class, how many would you expect to get a score of 5 or more
                (while assuming the null hypothesis is true)?</li>
              <li>If there are 40 students in your class who played the original psychic game, explain why it would
                not be surprising for at least one student to get a score that leads to a p-value < 0.05, even when no
                  one in the class has psychic abilities.</li>
              <li>Explain why it is not appropriate for someone to play the original psychic game 100 times and then
                use only their best score to “show evidence” that they are psychic.</li>
              <li>Terms such as p-hacking, data dredging, data fishing, or data snooping can all be used to describe
                when data is manipulated to create hypothesis tests with small p-values, when there are no meaningful
                conclusions. Tyler Vigen has created a website <a
                  href="https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations">here</a> that demonstrates one type of data
                manipulation focusing on the “multiple comparison problem.” In essence, this means a researcher conducts
                numerous hypothesis tests, then publishes only the tests with small p-values. Choose one graph from
                Tyler Vigen’s site and explain how this is an example of p-hacking.</li>
            </ul>
