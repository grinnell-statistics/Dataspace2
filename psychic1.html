		<h3> Part 1A: Introduction</h3>
        <p>Have you ever felt that you have a special ability to know something is true just through intuition? For example, have you ever played a casino game where you won because you correctly guessed the throw of the dice, the right card, or the color on a roulette wheel? If someone wins several times in a row, do they have special skills or are they just lucky? The Psychic Test below will evaluate your ability to predict the right card. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
    
	  <h3> Part 1B: The Psychic Test</h3>
    <p>
      You can test your skills on your phone here: https://itch.io/embed-upload/11864473?color=333333  or on the computer with this link: https://www.stat2games.sites.grinnell.edu/games/psychic.html   
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are some key terms that will be recorded during the test:
    </p>
    <br>
    <li>
      The game will ask you for a <strong>Player ID</strong>. You can use any name you like, but this will be on the internet. Use a code name that you will remember, but do not use a name that will easily identify you.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are playing this game for a course, your instructor will provide a <strong>Group ID</strong> so you can compete with everyone in your class.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click the <strong>Play</strong> button and see how many times you can correctly guess the right card.
    </li>
    <p>
      Your <strong>goal</strong> is to correctly guess which of the 5 cards will be selected. In this initial test, you will have 10 attempts, each with 5 cards. The number of attempts that you correctly guess will be automatically saved.
    </p>

		<h3> Part 1C: Exploring Example Data</h3>
                
		<p>How well did you do at guessing the right cards? Before we come to any conclusions about psychic abilities, we should carefully consider 
			several questions. For example:</p>
			<ul>
    			<li>How many does the average person, with no special abilities, get right?</li>
   				<li>How many would you need to correctly guess before we started to suspect there was something more going on than random guessing?</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Before we analyze your data, let's look at a sample dataset from a previous class of students, <a href="https://shiny.grinnell.edu/psychic1/">this
			 dataset</a>. Before answering any of the questions, make sure the settings in the app look like the image below.</p>

                <h3>Part 1D: Hypothesis Testing and p-values <img src="images/Challenge.jpg" width="35" height="38" alt="challenge icon"/></h3>
                
				<p>The above activity can be used to explain the core ideas behind statistical hypothesis tests. Hypothesis testing is a process used to determine 
					whether an event can reasonably be attributed to chance or whether there is some other explanation. </p>
                <br>
                <p>For example, let’s assume your friend, Akilah, claims to be psychic and you decide to test this claim using a test similar to the one above. There are 
                two possible conclusions we can make.</p>
                
                <li>Claim 1: Akilah has no special ability to predict the right card. Then we would expect that Akilah would typically get 1 out of 5 guesses correct. 
					This would also be equivalent to saying the probability of success is 0.2. Statisticians write this as a null hypothesis: Ho: p = 0.2. 
					Null hypotheses are typically what we assume before we collect any data. Here we use “p” to represent the assumed proportion.</li>
					<blockquote>
						<p><strong>Note:</strong> In every null hypothesis we are making several corresponding assumptions. It is important to identify these assumptions 
							before any test can be trusted. In this test, Claim 1 is also assuming:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The above Psychic Test is truly random. We assume that this test is not manipulated in a way that allows people to be more likely to guess the
								 right card correctly.</li>
							<li>Akilah is only playing one game. In other words, we are collecting one sample of data with 10 observations (10 attempts). Akilah did not play 
								the game multiple times and only her best score was shown.</li>
						</ul>
					</blockquote>

				<li>Claim 2: At least one of the assumptions in the null hypothesis is incorrect, meaning Akilah is expected to do better than 1 out of 5 correct guesses. This 
					would also be equivalent to saying the probability of success is greater than 0.2. Statisticians write this as an alternative hypothesis: Ha: p > 0.2.</li>
				<blockquote>
					<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to recognize that one hypothesis test, by itself, should never be enough to prove a theory, but it can be used to 
						determine how much evidence there is to support a theory. * [[See the American Statistical Association statement to see more details behind these ideas, https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/p-valuestatement.pdf]] </p>
				</blockquote>
                
                <p>Based on the data visualization in Part 1C, we can make conclusions based on Akilah’s score.</p>
                
                <li>Case 1): Let’s assume Akilah played your game and got 4 out of 10 correct, she would have done better than expected. However, the above app shows us that 12% of 
					the time people can get 4 or more correct just by chance. In terms of our statistical hypothesis test, the p-value = 0.12 does not give evidence to believe Akilah 
					does better than the average person with no abilities. Thus the sample data (Akilah’s score) provides no evidence to support the idea that Claim 2 is true. </li>
				<blockquote>
					<p>A p-value is a number between 0 and 1 that we use to quantify our decision. A p-value is the probability of observing an outcome while 
						assuming that the null hypothesis and all corresponding assumptions are true. </p>
					<p>In a hypothesis test, “no evidence” or "weak evidence" is typically associated with a large p-value (greater than 0.05), "moderate
						evidence" might fall in a range between 0.05 and 0.1, and "very strong evidence" would be a very small p-value (such as 0.01 or 
						lower) signifying a highly significant result against the null hypothesis.  </p>
				</blockquote>
				
				<p>The p-value is not the same as the p we use in our null and alternative hypotheses. </p>

				<li>CASE 2) Let’s assume Akilah got 6 out of 10 guesses correct. If the null hypothesis is true (p = 0.2) the probability that Akilah correctly guesses 6 or 
					more cards is 0.01. This may cause us to question the null hypothesis and conclude that something is helping Akilah correctly guess the cards (at least one of the assumptions in the null hypothesis is incorrect. </li>
					<blockquote>
						<p>A p-value = 0.01 provides very strong evidence against the null hypothesis, meaning that it is unlikely, but not impossible, that someone will correctly guess 6 or more cards just by random chance. However, p-values 
							never prove that our alternative hypothesis is true; it simply tells us how unlikely the null hypothesis is when only chance is involved.  </p>
						<p>Even if Case 2 is true, one hypothesis test does not prove Akilah has special abilities. Instead, we should say, “The observed data provides some evidence that leads us to question the null hypothesis.” The questions 
							below discuss additional questions to consider when conducting hypothesis tests.</p>
					</blockquote>

			<h3>Part 1E: Get Curious<img src="images/GetCurious.jpg" width="35" height="32" alt="get curious icon"/></h3>
				<ol>1. How did your class do? Sometimes it can take up to 60 minutes for your class data to show in the App above. After your instructor confirms enough 
				class data is available, answer the following questions.
					<br>
					<ol>
						a) Select your GroupID and use the summary statistics button to identify the mean, median and sample size of your class data. 
						<br>	
						b) Compare the histogram of your class data to the theoretical binomial distribution. Is the center, spread, and shape similar?
             			<br>
						c) If each student in your class played the game 10 times, providing 10 times more results, would you expect the class data to look more or 
						less like the theoretical binomial distribution?
						<br>
						d) What was the best score in your class? If there are 20 people in your class (20 games played), would you be surprised if one person got
						a “psychic” result by getting 5 or more correct?
					</ol>
				</ol>
						<ol>2. How does the number of cards influence our results? Play the game one more time with 10 attempts, however, only select 2 cards per 
						attempt instead of 5 cards per attempt.
                        <ol>
                            a) In the first game the probability of success was 1/5 = 0.2. What is the probability of success when there are only 2 cards per attempt?
                            <br>
                            b) When you have 10 attempts, with 2 cards each, how many successes would you expect to get?
                            <br>
                            would you expect to get? c) Use the App above to determine how many successes would be needed before you consider the result to be unusual
                            <br>
                        </ol>
                        </ol>
                        
							</ol> 
						<ol>3. In 2019, USA Today, stated that “For the 12th year in a row, Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium's manatees, brothers Hugh and Buffett, predicted the winner for the Super Bowl.” 
						Watch the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDUet_DD6q4  and you can see that Hugh has correctly predicted the Super Bowl 9 out of 11 times.
							<br>
							<ol>
								a) In this example, we can consider each year as an attempt and instead of using cards, they are selecting teams. For any given year, what is the 
								probability that Hugh and Buffet correctly guess the winner?
								<br>
							    b) Use the above App to estimate how likely is to get 9 out of 10 attempts correct? Does this cause you to think something other than random chance is involved?
								<br>
								c) Hugh had correctly picked 9 winners from 2008-2018 while Buffet had only correctly picked 6 winners. Does this mean that you should have gone with Hugh’s 2019 pick?
								<br>
								d) The USA Today article also shows other animals that have attempted to guess the Super Bowl winners, such as Fiona the Hippo, Kiki the Lioness, April the Giraffe, 
								and many others. Explain why it is NOT unusual for one animal to be able to predict so well.
							</ol>
                        </ol>
                         <ol>4. Your friend Eli, claims that he can tell the difference between two carbonated beverages, Coke and Pepsi. However, you are skeptical and think they 
                        taste the same. So you design a test to determine if Eli is right. You secretly pour Coke into one cup and Pepsi into a second cup. You give both cups 
                        to Eli at the same time and have him tell you which is Pepsi. You repeat this process 10 times and record the number of guesses that Eli got correct.
                            <ol>
                            a) State the null and alternative hypotheses.
                            <br>
                            b) If the null hypothesis is true, would you be surprised if Eli got 7 out of 10 correct? Use the App to explain your reasoning
                            <br>
                            c) In this test, Eli got 9 out of 10 correct. Use the App to find the p-value for this test. Based on this p-value would you conclude that the 
                                null hypothesis is correct (and Eli was just lucky) or would you conclude that the alternative is true (Eli can taste the difference between the 
                                two)? Explain your reasoning.
                            </ol>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <ol>5. How does the number of attempts (or sample size) influence our conclusions? Use the App to find the following probabilities for the psychic game.
                            <ol>
                            a) With 5 cards and 10 attempts, how likely is it that a person will get 40% correct (4 out of 10 correct guesses)?
                            <br>
                            b) With 5 cards and 20 attempts, how likely is it that a person will get 40% correct (8 out of 20 correct guesses)?
                            <br>
                            c) With 5 cards and 50 attempts, how likely is it that a person will get 40% correct (20 out of 50 correct guesses)?
                            <br>
                            d) Explain the pattern you see from part 5a – 5c. Why would you expect a larger number of observations to influence the probability of an outcome?
                            
                            </ol>
