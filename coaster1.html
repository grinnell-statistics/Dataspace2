      <h3 style="color:black;text-align: center"> How calculus is needed in roller coaster design</h3>

      <img src="coaster/coaster.jpg" alt="Coaster image" style="width:100%">

      <h3> Part 1 Introduction</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wondered what goes into designing a thrilling roller coaster? For example, have you ever
        experienced
        that rush of adrenaline as you plummet down a steep drop or twist through a high-speed turn? What makes certain
        roller coasters stand out from the rest—are they designed with specific elements to maximize excitement or is it
        all about the engineering? The activity below allows you to use concepts from calculus to design your own roller
        coaster.
      </p>

      <h3> Part 1B: Connecting Calculus and Coasters</h3>
      <p>This activity will focus on two core concepts discussed in most calculus classes: continuity and
        differentiability.</p>

      <p><strong>Continuity:</strong>continuous functions do not have any jumps or gaps.</p>
      <p><strong>Differentiability:</strong>a function is differentiable at a point when it is continuous and changes in
        a smooth manner without sudden changes in direction.
        In other words, the function must not have any sharp turns (like a "V" shape) at any point. The slope (i.e. the
        derivative) can be calculated at each point.</p>

      <p>On a roller coaster track, continuity and differentiability would ensure that the path is smooth, without sharp
        angles or breaks. The coaster would move in a smooth
        manner that helps riders maintain a sense of speed and excitement while avoiding jarring movements or even
        crashes.</p>

      <div style="width:100%">
        <br>
        <h3> 1C: Designing a Coaster</h3>

        <p>
          When designing your first roller coaster, you will create up to three functions, that when combined, will
          represent a roller coaster path that is continuous and differentiable. This means the track (the combination
          of
          all three functions) must flow smoothly without any breaks or sharp turns. You'll need to submit the
          following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The functions that represent the track.
          </li>
          <li>
            Calculations showing how the track is continuous and differentiable at the points where the three functions
            connect.
          </li>
          <li>
            A screenshot of your coaster design and your final score.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>
            You can build and visualize your coaster here:
          </strong>

          <a href="https://stat2games.sites.grinnell.edu/games/coaster.html"> Roller Coaster Game
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some key terms that will be recorded during the coaster game:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The game will ask you for a Player ID. You can use any name you like, but this will be on the internet. Use
            a
            code name that you will remember, but do not use a name that will easily identify you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the Group ID : friend
          </li>

          <li>
            Click the Play button and enter your roller coaster functions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your <strong>goal</strong> is to enter a smooth and continuous function that represent the most exciting
          roller
          coaster possible. The final score represents the level of excitement which is measured by the total changes in
          elevation of your coaster.

    <section id="mainContent"
      style="line-height:1.65;width:45%;float:left;padding-left:45px; padding-top:3%;font-family: Georgia;font-size:18px">

          <h3>1D: Example <img src="images/Challenge.jpg" width="35" height="38" alt="challenge icon" /></h3>
          <p>In the Figure 1, we have created a simple roller coaster.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The first function (the green line) shows the lift ramp of a roller coaster. Here we entered a simple
              linear
              function (y = 5 +1x). At the start of the roller coaster (x = 0), people would load at a height of y = 5.
              Typically, a coaster will have some type of conveyor to get you to the top of the coaster, then gravity
              will
              carry you through the rest of the coaster.
            </li>
            <li>
              The equation entries require that the ending x value of the first equation is the starting value of the
              next
              equation. This ensures that there are no horizontal gaps in the coaster.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Graph and Math Check buttons allow us to verify that the coaster will work. To be continuous the y
              value
              of the first function when x = 20 must equal the y value of the second function when x = 20. This ensures
              that
              there are no vertical gaps in the coaster.
            </li>
            <li>
              The second function is quadratic, allowing the coaster to have a smooth curve. If two linear equations are
              put
              next to each other, the graph would have a sharp V-shaped curve, meaning that it would not be
              differentiable
              (and not safe to ride).
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to be differentiable the slope of the first line and the slope of the second line must also be
              equal
              at x = 20.
            </li>
            <li>
              Here the second and third functions are the same (except for the x-axis), this is not necessary, just two
              equations could be listed and the cells in the last row can all be blank. To get more points, more curves
              are
              needed.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            In this version of the game, there are some restrictions:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              You can enter 1, 2, or 3 functions.
            </li>

            <li>
              The x-axis must go from 0 to 50
            </li>
            <li>
              The height of the coaster must always be greater than 0
            </li>
            <li>
              Before building your coaster, you should use the Math Check button to ensure that your functions are
              continuous and differentiable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your score, which is based on elevation changes, only starts after your coaster starts changing direction.
              In
              other words, if you just draw a straight line that only goes up, your score will be 0.
            </li>
          </ol>
