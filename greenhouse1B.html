		<h3> Part 1 Introduction</h3>
	<p> The Greenhouse game invites players to grow and sell crops on a virtual farm. If players want to make money, they must be careful about the amount of water, fertilizer, and sunlight each crop receives. While players can choose any options they like, they are more likely to profit if they use the interactive graphs and statistical models to improve their strategies. Here are some key terms each player should know:
	  </p>
		<dd>
		<li>
		<strong>Yield</strong> is the amount of crops produced. It is measured by the number of bushels produced for each plot. In this game, yields reflect actual crop growth in Iowa farmland.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		A <strong>bushel</strong> originally was a large basket used to carry crops. For example, a bushel of corn typically weighs about 56 pounds. 
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<strong>Water</strong> is the amount of water (in inches) that you assign to each plot. 
		</li>
		
		<li>
		A <strong>plot</strong> is the area of ground where you are planning your seeds. In this Greenhouse game, each test plot represents 1/10th of an acre of land. 
		</li>
		
		<li>
		The game will ask you for a <strong>Player ID</strong>. You can use any name you like, but this will be on the internet, so do not use a name that will easily identify you.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		If you are playing this game for a course, your instructor will provide a <strong>Group ID</strong> so you will be able to compete with everyone in your class.
		</li>
		</dd>
		<hr>
		<h3>Step 1A: Learning the Greenhouse Game</h3>
		<p>To learn how to play the game, watch the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_pdfB-y5sU">video </a>below</p>
		<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_pdfB-y5sU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		
		<br>
		
		
		
	
	<br>
		<hr>
	<h3> Step 1B: Collecting Data</h3>
	<p>
		We will begin by using the Greenhouse game (below) to collect data that will help us <strong>estimate the corn yield based upon the amount of water.</strong>
	  </p>
		<p>
		  The game will ask you for a <strong>Player ID</strong> (see Figure 1). This will be on the internet, so do not use a name that will easily identify you. You will also need to input a  <strong>Group ID</strong>. Your instructor may give you a Group ID that will be identical for every person in the class. Select Level 1.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		 On the next screen, enter the values as you see in Figure 2. Select <strong> Randomized Play, </strong> which will assign each of your selected treatments (crop type and water amount) to a randomly selected plot.
		</p>

		</section>
		<p>
		<strong>NOTE</strong>: At this point, do not worry about winning or profits; just carefully follow the instructions below to collect data.
		</p>
		
		<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you are unable to play the game, either try a different browser or go to the game website directly <a href="https://www.stat2games.sites.grinnell.edu/games/greenhouse.html">here.</a>

		</aside>
			
				<hr>
				
				<p style = "font-family: Georgia;font-size:18px; line-height: 1.65">
					After you select <strong>Randomized Play</strong>, you will be able to: 
					
					<br>
					
					<li style="padding-left:0px; font-size:18px; margin-left: 20px">  Move your cursor over each plot to identify the crop type and the amount of water the plot has received.
					</li> <br>
					<li style="padding-left:0px; font-size:18px; margin-left: 20px">  Click the <strong>Harvest</strong> button on the right. Then click <strong> Sell All</strong> to sell your crops. The game will display how much profit you made.
					</li> <br>
					<li style="padding-left:0px; font-size:18px; margin-left: 20px"> Then enter your income, expenses, and profit using the <strong>Creating Graphs</strong> form below. You will complete the form in the next section, Step 1C: Exploring Example Data.

			<h3>Get Curious  <img src="nypd/get_curious_icon.png" width="20" height="22" alt="get curious"/></h3>
				<ol>1. Use the App with Example Data (above) to address the following questions: 
					<br>
					<ol>
						a) Notice that the yields vary, even when the same amount of water is used. Explain why this should be expected. 
						<br>	
						b) Modify the <strong>X Axis Limits</strong>. When is a linear model a good fit for this data? When is a linear model a poor fit for this data?
             			<br>
						c) If modifying the range of the data improves the linear model, would it be appropriate to remove some of our data? Why or why not?<br>
					</ol>

				</ol>
						<ol>Confirm that the App with Class Data (below) now includes all data from your class. Sometimes it can take up to 60 minutes for your class data to show in the app below.</ol> 				
						<ol>To evaluate your class data, provide <strong>Settings B</strong> (at left) in the app below.</ol>
						<iframe style="float:right;border:none" src="https://shiny.grinnell.edu/dataspace/greenhouse2/" width="70%" height="950px"></iframe>
						<br><br>
						<ol><p><strong>Settings B</strong></p></ol>
						<ol>Group ID:   <strong>[provided by instructor]</strong></ol>
						<ol>X-axis Variable:   <strong>Water</strong></ol>
						<ol>Y-axis Variable:   <strong>Yield</strong></ol>
						<ol>Statistical Model:   <strong>Linear</strong></ol>
						
			
			<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
			
			
						<ol>2. Use the App with Class Data to review your class data and address the following questions:
						<br>
								<ol>
									a) What is the explanatory variable and response variable for this data? 
									<br>	
									b) What are the units (what does each point represent)?
									<br>
									c) Does it look as though all the players followed the instructions in Step 1B? Explain why or why not.
									<br>
									d) Do the results from your class agree with the data in the App with Example Data? Explain why or why not.
									<br>
									e) Try some different statistical models. Which one looks like it best describes the data?
									<br>
									f) What conclusions can you draw from this data and the corresponding regression model?
								</ol>
							</ol> 
						<ol>3. Address the following questions about different ways we could have conducted this study to improve the quality of our data:
							<br>
							<ol>
								a) Are there better variables to use? For example, what would be the benefits to using <em>Profit</em> or <em>Revenue</em> as the response variable instead of <em>Yield</em>? 
								<br>
								b)	What are the benefits to randomizing the amount of water assigned to each plot?
								<br>
								c) How many plots would need to be tested to convince you that there is a relationship between <em>Water</em> and <em>Yield</em>?
							</ol>
                        </ol>
			
						<ol>4. How would you optimize Greenhouse profits for corn in Level 1?
						<br>
							<ol>
							a) Provide a graph and briefly explain how the graph helps you determine the amount of water that would give you the highest profits.
							<br>
							b) Go back to the beginning of the game and select Level 1 in the Greenhouse game. Your goal is to play one season and make the most profit possible based upon any amount of water.
							<br>
								<ol>
								i.	Use the same Player ID, but add a “2” to your Group ID. For example, if your Group ID was Stat101Spring2022, now use Stat101Spring20222.
									<br>
								ii. Make sure you select only the corn crop, but choose any other option you prefer.
									<br>
								iii. After playing one season, submit your Player ID, Income, Expenses, and Profits.

								</ol>
							
							</ol>
						
						</ol>
			
			
						<ol>Confirm that the Game Level 1 High Scores App (below) now includes the data that you just generated. How? Sometimes it can take up to 60 minutes for your class data to show in the app below. </ol>
			
						<ol>Enter your new Group ID below to see how you compared with the rest of your class. </ol>
						<iframe style="float:center;border:none" src="https://shiny.grinnell.edu/dataspace/GHLevel1HighScores/" width="100%" height="450px"></iframe>
						<ol> 5.	In order to create a meaningful regression model, we should take into account possible <strong>confounding variables</strong> [variables that the researcher did not include in the study but that might be connected to both the explanatory (independent) variable and the response (dependent) variable]. List at least two potential confounding variables that might get in the way of determining the relationship between Water and Yield.</ol>
						<ol>6. Take a few minutes to read the one-page <strong>Nature article</strong>. It is available here: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/431525a">https://www.nature.com/articles/431525a.</a> <br>
							<ol>
							
								a) What are the two explanatory variables?
								<br>
								b) What is the response variable for this data?
								<br>
								c) What was the authors’ reasoning for focusing on the simple linear regression technique and not the other techniques mentioned?
								<br>
								d) Do the authors’ arguments seem reasonable? Give a brief explanation as to why you agree or disagree with the authors’ conclusions.
								<br>
							</ol>
