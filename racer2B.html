        <h3> Collecting, Organizing and Drawing Conclusions from Data</h3>

        <p> Much like the behind-the-scenes experts on <em>Top Gear</em> who run data-gathering tests to spin into
          easy-to-digest soundbites for everyday audience members, you now have the start of the information you need to
          put together some statistics based on the Racer game. </p>

        <h3> Introduction </h3>
        <p> In this lab, your goal is to complete a research study based on the Racer game. Just like last time, each
          car can be raced multiple times on a track and the time to complete each race will be recorded. This time,
          however, there are three drivers (just think of them as our rather roguish <em>Top Gear</em> hosts!) –
          Classic, Cruiser, and HotRod. After you race the cars, you can analyze the data in the table. </p>
        <h3> 2A: Designing an Experiment</h3>

        <p>Many people assume that statistics focuses on calculations. Have you spent time in Las Vegas, Atlantic City,
          or even just a plain old casino? It’s easy to think that betting on something like, say, the World Cup or
          Super Bowl comes down to a bunch of math problems pitted against each other – when in reality, there are a lot
          of other variables that figure in when calculating those odds. Most real-world statisticians spend much more
          time properly collecting data (or cleaning/organizing data) than they do on the calculations. For example,
          before collecting any data for an experiment involving the Racer game, a researcher should look at all of the
          steps below:</p>

        <p>
        <ol>
          <li> <strong> Develop a hypothesis</strong> about the population of all races. Here are a few examples:</li>
          <dd>• I believe that on average, the Classic car is faster than the HotRod Car.</dd>
          <dd>• I believe that on average, the HotRod car will complete a race faster than the Cruiser car.</dd>
          <dd>• I believe that at least one of the average Finish Times is different for the Classic, Cruiser, or HotRod
            cars.</dd>
          <li> Determine how you will <strong> collect your sample</strong></li>
          <dd>• What will you consider as an observation? For example, will it be a player, an individual race, a pair
            of races, a car, or a track?</dd>
          <dd>• How many samples will you collect?</dd>
          <dd>• What is the explanatory variable? Is it categorical or quantitative?</dd>
          <dd>• What is the response variable? Is it categorical or quantitative?</dd>
          <dd>• How will randomization be incorporated into the data collection?</dd>
          <dd>• What specific data needs to be recorded with each race?</dd>
          <dd>• What graphs or statistical methods do you plan to use once you collect the data? In the example below,
            we discuss using a paired t-test.</dd>
          <li><strong>Identify potential confounding variables.</strong> &nbsp;Once again, it’s key to take into account
            possible <strong>confounding variables</strong> (variables that the researcher did not include in the study
            but that might be connected to both the independent variable and the dependent variable), to determine if
            the car speeds are in fact truly different. Here’s an example: some racetracks are longer than others. We
            want to hold the track constant for everyone in your experiment to ensure that the type of track does not
            bias our results. Are there any other potential confounding variables that might get in the way of
            determining which car is faster?&nbsp; </li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h3> 2B: Collecting Data</h3>

        <p>Unlike the cavalier folks in<em> Top Gear</em>, who thumb their noses at the rules, researchers need clear
          <strong>protocols</strong> (instructions) so that the experimental data is collected using the same process
          every time. Documentation of these protocols also enables other researchers to verify the validity of the
          data. If collecting data as a class, clearly identify the exact protocols and timeframe for collecting data.
          For example, here are the protocols for data collected in an earlier class:&nbsp;</p>

        <li><a>All data was collected during class time on a computer in the statistics lab room.</a></li>
        <li><a>Students logged onto the site and went to the Racer game.</a></li>
        <li><a>Make sure you enter the correct&nbsp; <em><strong>GroupID </strong> and
              <strong>PlayerID</strong></em>.</a></li>
        <li><a>Click on the &nbsp;<em><strong style="">Paired Test</strong></em>&nbsp; button on the main menu after
            logged in.</a></li>
        <li><a>Each student in the class will race exactly two times on the <em><strong style="">Oval
                Track</strong></em>. Prior to racing the cars, students were randomly assigned which car they would race
            first.</a></li>
        <li><a>Click on the &nbsp;<em><strong style="">left box to select the car you will race first</strong></em>.</a>
        </li>
        <li><a>Then select &nbsp;<em><strong style="">the car you will race second</strong></em>.</a></li>
        <li><a>Then select the &nbsp;<em><strong style="">SELECT TRACK</strong>.</em> button.</a></li>
        <li><a>Then click the &nbsp;<em><strong style="">START &nbsp;</strong></em>button.</a></li>
        <li><a>Use the arrow keys to race the car.</a></li>

        <h3> 2C: Examining Data</h3>

        <p> Before you start any calculations, it is essential to examine your data. Ask yourself the following
          questions for the data collected in the Racer game.</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Were there any players who did not properly follow protocols? Did they play the game an incorrect number
            of times? Did they use the wrong cars or tracks? Can their data be included? </li>
          <li>Were there any outliers or skewed data? How does this influence our analysis? Should these outliers be
            removed?
          </li>
          <li>Some people have a natural talent for video games; to others, it’s a completely foreign concept. How can
            we account for player skill level? </li>
          <li>How do we account for the influence of order in which cars are raced? For example, would you expect
            players to perform better after practicing with the first car?&nbsp;</li>
          <li>How does the variation in effect size (the difference between means) compare to the random variation in
            our data?</li>
          <li>Are there any other issues that may cause our data to be unreliable or invalid?</li>
          <li>What conditions are required to conduct a statistical analysis? How can you evaluate whether these
            conditions were met? If the sample size is small, it is particularly important to verify that the conditions
            are satisfied. What should you do if the needed conditions are not met? </li>

        </ol>

        Watch the following video to see an example of how data cleaning can influence a statistical analysis.

            Make sure that you address all three steps in the <strong>Designing an Experiment</strong> section.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Using your class data, answer the seven questions identified in the <strong>Examining the Data</strong>

          <li>If you collected data properly, you can use the app to analyze it. However, if your data was not properly
            collected, your instructor can provide a cleaned dataset for you. Use the data to conduct a test and make a
            decision about whether there is a difference in the population average finishing time of the Classic and

          <li>How much do your conclusions depend on the data cleaning that was done? </li>
          <br>
          <li>Could different response variables (Finish Time versus Top Speed versus Time to 30) result in different
            conclusions? Why or why not?</li>

          <br>
          <li>Does the hypothesis test or confidence interval provide more helpful information for our study? In
            particular, does the hypothesis test and p-value provide a good measure of the difference between average

          <br>
          <li>The game on this page is simplistic. More advanced versions of this game, allowing for numerous types of
