        <p>
          The United States has the largest prison population and highest
          per-capita incarceration rate in the world. Both metrics have grown
          significantly in the past century, heavily outpacing population
          growth. Furthermore, “The US spends $270 billion annually funding
          the criminal justice system and maintaining
          <a
            href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/04/23/cea-report-economic-perspectives-incarceration-and-criminal-justice">
            prisons.</a>” To incarcerated individuals, there is an approximate economic
          loss of
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2835847/">
            $15 billion annually</a>, wholly from tangible cost. With such high costs associated with
          imprisonment, it would be reasonable to expect the criminal justice
          system to carefully ensure a fair system when sentencing people to
          prison.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the fairness of the criminal justice system in the United
          States is currently being questioned. People convicted of the same
          crime can serve dramatically different prison sentences. In some
          instances, perpetrators convicted of heinous crimes, such as murder
          or rape, have faced
          <a
            href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/03/bus-driver-shane-pinche-wont-go-prison-rape-hes-not-alone/3653181002/">little
            to no prison time</a>. In other circumstances, convicted individuals have been sentenced
          to life in prison for petty theft, such as stealing

            dollars</a>, a pair of

		">
            slice of pizza</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When sentencing someone to prison, it is important to consider any
          extenuating circumstances. Even when the outcome of a crime is
          similar, such as an individual dying, the sentence should reflect
          whether it was the result of an accident, negligence, or intent to
          do harm to another. Another key consideration is the likelihood of
          the defendant committing another crime, commonly known as
          <strong>recidivism</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          One major criticism of the United States’ prison system is that the
          extenuating circumstances are not evaluated fairly by judges and
          juries. It is difficult to avoid the influence of personal biases
          and opinions in determining a suspect's guilt, intent, and
          likelihood of recidivating. What if there was a way to limit the
          influence of human bias in sentencing while also accurately
          predicting whether an individual would recidivate? This was the
          promise of machine learning.
        </p>
        <h3>Recidivism in the United States</h3>
        <p>
          There is a high likelihood for convicted prisoners to recidivate. A
          U.S. Bureau of Justice report studied 401,288 released prisoners
          across 30 states in 2005 and found that 83% of released prisoners
          were arrested at least once after their release, with most arrests
          occurring within
          <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/rprts05p0510.pdf">5 years of release</a>.
        </p>
        <img src="recidivism/Recidivism rates yearly timeline.png" alt="Recidivism Graph 1" class="center" />
        <p>
          Since recidivism is such an important issue in the United States, it
          is imperative that the judge and jury have a good way of assessing
          the risk of someone reoffending without including personal bias.
          Some criminologists believe that using automated machine learning
          algorithms would be able to eliminate such bias. They argue that,
          since machine learning algorithms quantify the probability of
          someone recidivating based on statistical techniques and do not
          include human interference, they should be unbiased.
        </p>

        <p>
          One machine learning algorithm used to predict the likelihood of
          recidivism for a convicted person is the ‘Correctional Offender
          Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions’ or COMPAS algorithm
          for short, which was created in 1998 by a private firm, Northpointe.
          This algorithm has been criticized for it's lack of accuracy, but
          still used in
          <a
            href="https://stanfordpolitics.org/2020/09/13/ai-prediction-tools-claim-to-alleviate-an-overcrowded-american-justice-system-but-should-they-be-used/">
            several states</a>. Its legality has also started to be put into question. In 2015,
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/opinion/algorithm-compas-sentencing-bias.html">Eric Loomis</a>
          was sentenced to six years of imprisonment and five years of
          extended supervision for driving a car that had been used in a
          shooting in 2013. The COMPAS algorithm’s output for him was taken
          into consideration when he was sentenced. Eric was classified as a
          high-risk individual by the algorithm. Eric Loomis appealed his
          decision, claiming his due process right to be sentenced based on
          accurate information was violated, as guaranteed by the 14th
          amendment.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the Wisconsin Supreme Court and Court of Appeals denied his
          appeal. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court refused to even
          hear the case. Although Eric was not able to view the proprietary
          algorithm that Northpointe developed, the Wisconsin court cited that
          he was still able to challenge the risk score itself and that the
          studies have shown that the algorithm “was reasonably accurate”.
          However, if a COMPAS risk assement is used, it must contain a
          written notice listing its limitations. Whenever the COMPAS
          algorithm is used,
          <strong>the notice states that the algorithm has been found to
            disproportionately classify minority offenders as having a higher
            risk of recidivism</strong>. The notice also states that the defendants are compared to a
          national sample, and that no cross-validation study has been
          completed with the Wisconsin population.
        </p>

        <p>
          More cases have discussed the recidivism prediction issue, but they
          have also come to the conclusion that risk assessment algorithms,
          like COMPAS, should be allowed to be used for prison sentencing and
          do not violate an individual's right to be sentenced on accurate
          information. However, in the next section we show that the use of a
          different type of machine learning algorithm, called “random
          forests’, produces different results.

        <h3>
          Can machine learning algorithms reduce bias when predicting
          recidivism?
        </h3>

        <p>
          Many states, such as
          <a
            href="https://stanfordpolitics.org/2020/09/13/ai-prediction-tools-claim-to-alleviate-an-overcrowded-american-justice-system-but-should-they-be-used/">New
            York, California, Florida</a>, have used government funds to purchase the COMPAS algorithm to
          assist judges in determining the length of over one million
          defendants’ sentences based on their likelihood of recidivating. The
          algorithm takes in public criminal profile data and a set of 137
          interview questions answered by the defendant, which are used to
          gather information on past criminal involvement, relationships,
          lifestyle, personality, familial background, and education level, to
          produce a 1-10 score representing the risk level of the individual
          recidivating. Since the algorithm was created by a private firm,
          certain details are proprietary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Northpointe claimed the COMPAS algorithm was unbiased against race,
          since it does not include race when making its predictions.
          ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that aims to produce investigative
          journalism in the public interest, decided to test this claim.
        </p>

        <p>
          In an independent evaluation of COMPAS, ProPublica looked at 7,000
          individuals arrested in Broward County, Florida from 2013 to 2014.
          They found that only 20% of individuals predicted by COMPAS to
          commit violent crimes actually
          <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">did</a>.
          Another troubling conclusion is that the false positive rate --
          that is, the rate at which people who were predicted to recidivate
          but did not -- was significantly higher for Black defendants (44.9%)
          than white defendants (23.5%). An additional study found that
          COMPAS’
          <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/4/1/eaao5580.full.pdf">highest level of accuracy was
            65%</a>, and that human participants were more capable of predicting
          recidivism than COMPAS.
        </p>
        <img src="recidivism/Human vs Compas prediction graph.png" alt="Graph2" class="center" />
        <p style="color: grey">
          In that same study that claimend the highest level of accuracy was
          65%, it also showed that humans were on par with COMPAS in
          prediciting recidivism
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the algorithm does not include race when making its
          predictions, several COMPAS survey questions are likely correlated
          with race. The Columbia law professor, Bernard Harcourt, makes the
          <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1677654">connection
          </a>
          that risk of recidivating is predominatly tied to criminal history
          which is a proxy for race.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, when considering what data to collect and include in
          a model, bias can unknowingly be introduced into any algorithm, and
          when the model influences the length of an individual’s time in
          prison, the effects may be devastating.
