				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p> Think back to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, shortly after a novel coronavirus disease was
					first identified and reported on December 31, 2019. Within weeks, the virus had spread to dozens of
					countries, with cases climbing quickly. Hospitals rapidly became <a
						href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(21)00068-0/fulltext">overloaded
						and short-staffed</a>, ICU beds were full, and healthcare workers were put under an immense
					mental and physical toll, having to work overtime under psychological distress.
				</p>
				<p>
					Numerous government organizations have been turning to epidemiologists to:
				</p>
				<p>
					1) Understand and predict how the pandemic will progress, and </p>
				<p>
					2) Determine which actions to take to prevent the spread of the disease. </p>
				<p>This site will discuss both of these core ideas. While the model shown below is a simplified model,
					it is very similar to the models used by many government organizations in the early days of the
					pandemic. </p>


				<h2 style="font:bold;font-size:20px"><strong>Part 1:&nbsp;A <span style="font-size:18px"> Susceptible
							(S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R) </span> Model</strong></h2>



				<p>Epidemiologists often use SIR models to represent the spread of diseases. This is a compartment-based
					model, meaning each person in the population is considered to be within one of several compartments.
					In this model, each person in a population is considered to be either Susceptible (S), Infected (I),
					or Recovered/Removed (R). This means that at any given time, a person is either:
					<li> <em>Susceptible</em> to infection, meaning that they have not yet been infected.</li>
					<li> <em>Infected</em>, meaning that they currently have the disease and are capable of spreading it
						to other <em>susceptible</em> people. In other words, they are contagious.</li>
					<li> <em>Recovered/Removed</em>, meaning that the person is no longer contagious; they have either
						recovered from the disease or have died and been removed from the population. Either way, they
						are no longer <em>infected</em> or <em>susceptible</em> to infection.</li>

					Then, equations are used to determine how people in the population will move from
					<em>susceptible</em> to <em>infected</em> and from <em>infected</em> to <em>recovered/removed</em>.

				<h2 style="font:bold;font-size:18px"><strong>Exploring an SIR Model</strong></h2>
				<p style="font-size:18px;color:black">In any model, we <em> <strong> start with multiple
							assumptions:</strong></em></p>
				<div class="row">
					<section class="6u" style="width:100%;font-size:18px">

						<li><strong>Population ( N ): </strong> We assume there are a fixed number of people in the
							population. In the case of COVID-19 modeling done for national governments, the population
							of interest is likely to be the total population of the country. However, SIR models can
							also be used to predict the spread of a disease in a smaller closed community, such as
							people on a cruise ship or in a prison. </li>
						<li> <strong>Initial Infected (Infected<sub>Day = 1</sub>):</strong> The number of people
							infected with the disease on the day that the model "starts".</li>
						<li> <strong>Transmission Rate: </strong>A measure of how quickly the disease will spread. This
							is expressed as the number of susceptible people that each infected person will infect per
							day, on average. Transmission rate could be determined by factors such as:
							<ul>
								<li> The probability that a <em>susceptible </em>person who comes into contact with an
									<em>infected</em> person will themselves become <em>infected</em>.</li>
								<li>The number of other people that a given person comes into contact with on any given
									day.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>


						<li> <strong>Recovery Rate: </strong> A measure of how long people take to move from
							<em>infected</em> to <em>recovered</em>. This is expressed as the proportion of people who
							are currently <em>infected</em> who will move to the <em>recovered/removed</em> compartment
							per day.</li>



						<p> Models also include implicit assumptions. A major assumption of the SIR model is that once a
							person has recovered from the disease, they cannot catch the disease again. Of course, we
							know now that recovering from COVID-19 does not provide a person with lifelong immunity to
							reinfection in the same way that recovering from, say, measles or chicken pox does, which
							makes it problematic to model COVID-19 with a basic SIR model such as this one. However, in
							early 2020 epidemiologists assumed that recovery from COVID-19 would confer such immunity.
						</p>

						<p> Each one of the formally assumed values can dramatically influence the model. However, in
							reality, these values are not known, especially at the beginning of an epidemic. Thus,
							researchers must estimate each of the assumed values. Below is an app that illustrates a
							basic SIR model. Try changing the parameters to see how they affect the overall spread of
							the disease. Then, answer the questions to the right to check your understanding. By
							understanding this model and the calculations below, we can see why at the beginning of the
							pandemic the spread of COVID-19 was often represented as a "curve".</p>

            1B: Visualizing the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) Model
          </h2>
          <p>
            The simulation below illustrates how SIR models are used to track the spread of disease. At any given time, each person (depicted as a colored dot) is placed into one of the SIR compartments. In this simple model, we start with a population of 100 people. This could represent the number of people on a cruise ship or a small island. Two infected people interact with the 98 susceptible people on the island, and the number of new infections rises quickly. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Click the “play” button to see how the number of infected people quickly rises and then decreases as more people move to the recovered compartment.

        Part 1D: Discussion Questions
      </h2>

      <p>
        The SIR model in the above app has several assumptions that help us keep the mathematics simpler: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The population is constant, no people are entering or leaving the population during the period we are studying.
        </li>
        <li>
          The transmission rate is constant, we assume that everyone in the population is intermixing and everyone has an equal chance of contracting the disease.
        </li>
        <li>
          Everyone who has the disease is sick for the same amount of time.
        </li>
        <li>
          The virus stays constant, it doesn't mutate in any way.
        </li>
        <li>
          People can only go from susceptible to infected and from infected to removed/recovered. In other words, once a person is in the removed compartment, they cannot infect others and they cannot contract the disease again.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        More complex compartment models are created to address each of these issues. However, it is essential to realize that all models are based on assumptions. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pick one of the above assumptions and discuss why it should not be used in modeling the COVID-19 pandemic.
          <p>
            It can be very helpful to create models that allow us to estimate the effects of a virus on the population. However, researchers can not know the actual transmission rate or recovery rates at the beginning of an epidemic. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The model depends heavily on the assumptions made by the researchers who are developing the model. For example, what is the transmission rate when people are wearing masks versus when they are not wearing masks? How does social distancing help to lower the transmission rate? How do the two interact? The answers to questions such as these can have massive implications on the impact of an epidemic.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a lot of discussion in the national news media about “flattening the curve.” What do you think was meant by this phrase in the context of the SIR model? Do you think this was a good description of the problem for a person with no technical understanding of the SIR model? Why or why not? 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          A key measure used in epidemic modeling is Ro. This is a unitless measure of the total number of people each infected person will infect. R. is calculated as beta/gamma. It is the number of people an Infected person will infect times the number of days the person has been infected. Try various transmission rates and recovery rates in the app above and explain how a higher or lower Ro value will impact an epidemic.
        </li>
      </ol>
