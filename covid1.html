					Exploring Epidemic Models 
				</h1>

				<h2>Part 1 Introduction</h2>
				<p> On December 31, 2019, health authorities worldwide received a sobering wake-up call: a mysterious 
					virus had emerged in Wuhan, China, and was beginning to spread. Within weeks, this unidentified 
					threat crossed borders, reaching countries across the globe. Case numbers surged dramatically, 
					overwhelming hospitals, filling intensive care units, and stretching healthcare professionals to 
					their breaking point as they fought to contain the escalating crisis.
				</p>
				<p>
					When a new virus appears—whether it’s a familiar nuisance like the common cold or a worldwide 
					emergency like a pandemic—scientists rely on a critical tool: <strong>epidemic modeling</strong>. This approach 
					provides answers to pressing questions: 

				</p>
				<ul>
					<li> How quickly will this virus spread?</li>
					<li> How many people will be affected?</li>
					<li> What can we do to slow or stop the outbreak?</li>
				</ul>
					

				<hr>
				<h2 style="font-size:20px"><strong>1A: <span style="font-size:18px"> 
					What Influences the Spread of a Viral Disease?</span></strong></h2>



				<p>In this article, we explore how the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) 
					model can address the above questions. It is a compartment-based model, 
					meaning each person in the population is considered to be within one of 
					the following three groups:
					<ul>
						<li><strong style="color: rgb(236, 207, 23);">Susceptible (S):</strong> People who haven’t been infected yet.
						</li>
						<li><strong style="color: red;">Infected (I):</strong> People currently infected and able to pass the disease on.
						</li>
						<li><strong style="color: rgb(115, 115, 241);">Recovered/Removed (R):</strong> People who have recovered from the 
							disease or have died and been removed from the population. Either way, they are no longer infected or susceptible 
							to infection.
						</li>
					</ul>

					While simplified, the SIR model serves as the foundation for more complex models used by government organizations 
					to monitor and analyze the progression of a pandemic. It helps predict the trajectory of an epidemic, providing 
					valuable insights that inform decisions to protect public health.
				</p>
				<p>
				Four key variables influence how many people move from one of the SIR compartments to another.
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Population (N):</strong>The total number of people in the population. </li>
					<li><strong>Initial Infected (I<sub>0</sub>):</strong>The number of people infected with the disease on the day that
						 the model "starts".</li>
					<li><strong>Transmission Rate (&beta;):</strong>A measure of how quickly the disease will spread. This is the 
						expected number of susceptible people that each infected person will infect per day.</li>
					<li><strong>Recovery Rate (&gamma;):</strong>This is the expected proportion of people who are currently infected
						 who will move to the recovered/removed compartment per day.</li>
				</ul>

				In reality, the transmission and recovery rates are unknown, especially at the beginning of an epidemic. Thus, researchers
				must estimate each of the values. More detailed calculations are provided later. For now, we can use the app below to see
				how these parameters can influence how quickly the virus spreads and the number of people infected.

            1B: Visualizing the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) Model
          </h2>
          <p>
            The simulation below illustrates how SIR models are used to track the spread of disease. At any given time, each person (depicted as a colored dot) is placed into one of the SIR compartments. In this simple model, we start with a population of 100 people. This could represent the number of people on a cruise ship or a small island. Two infected people interact with the 98 susceptible people on the island, and the number of new infections rises quickly. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Click the “play” button to see how the number of infected people quickly rises and then decreases as more people move to the recovered compartment.

        Part 1D: Discussion Questions
      </h2>

      <p>
        The SIR model in the above app has several assumptions that help us keep the mathematics simpler: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The population is constant, no people are entering or leaving the population during the period we are studying.
        </li>
        <li>
          The transmission rate is constant, we assume that everyone in the population is intermixing and everyone has an equal chance of contracting the disease.
        </li>
        <li>
          Everyone who has the disease is sick for the same amount of time.
        </li>
        <li>
          The virus stays constant, it doesn't mutate in any way.
        </li>
        <li>
          People can only go from susceptible to infected and from infected to removed/recovered. In other words, once a person is in the removed compartment, they cannot infect others and they cannot contract the disease again.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        More complex compartment models are created to address each of these issues. However, it is essential to realize that all models are based on assumptions. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pick one of the above assumptions and discuss why it should not be used in modeling the COVID-19 pandemic.
          <p>
            It can be very helpful to create models that allow us to estimate the effects of a virus on the population. However, researchers can not know the actual transmission rate or recovery rates at the beginning of an epidemic. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The model depends heavily on the assumptions made by the researchers who are developing the model. For example, what is the transmission rate when people are wearing masks versus when they are not wearing masks? How does social distancing help to lower the transmission rate? How do the two interact? The answers to questions such as these can have massive implications on the impact of an epidemic.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a lot of discussion in the national news media about “flattening the curve.” What do you think was meant by this phrase in the context of the SIR model? Do you think this was a good description of the problem for a person with no technical understanding of the SIR model? Why or why not? 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          A key measure used in epidemic modeling is Ro. This is a unitless measure of the total number of people each infected person will infect. R. is calculated as beta/gamma. It is the number of people an Infected person will infect times the number of days the person has been infected. Try various transmission rates and recovery rates in the app above and explain how a higher or lower Ro value will impact an epidemic.
        </li>
      </ol>
