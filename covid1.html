					How do we better understand epidemic models and how public policy can influence the disease spread?
				</h1>
				<img src="covid/Stock 1.1.jpg" alt="Police" style="width:100%">

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p> Think back to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, shortly after a novel coronavirus disease was
					first identified and reported on December 31, 2019. Within weeks, the virus had spread to dozens of
					countries, with cases climbing quickly. Hospitals rapidly became <a
						href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(21)00068-0/fulltext">overloaded
						and short-staffed</a>, ICU beds were full, and healthcare workers were put under an immense
					mental and physical toll, having to work overtime under psychological distress.
				</p>
				<p>
					Numerous government organizations have been turning to epidemiologists to:
				</p>
				<p>
					1) Understand and predict how the pandemic will progress, and </p>
				<p>
					2) Determine which actions to take to prevent the spread of the disease. </p>
				<p>This site will discuss both of these core ideas. While the model shown below is a simplified model,
					it is very similar to the models used by many government organizations in the early days of the
					pandemic. </p>


				<h2 style="font:bold;font-size:20px"><strong>Part 1:&nbsp;A <span style="font-size:18px"> Susceptible
							(S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R) </span> Model</strong></h2>



				<p>Epidemiologists often use SIR models to represent the spread of diseases. This is a compartment-based
					model, meaning each person in the population is considered to be within one of several compartments.
					In this model, each person in a population is considered to be either Susceptible (S), Infected (I),
					or Recovered/Removed (R). This means that at any given time, a person is either:
					<li> <em>Susceptible</em> to infection, meaning that they have not yet been infected.</li>
					<li> <em>Infected</em>, meaning that they currently have the disease and are capable of spreading it
						to other <em>susceptible</em> people. In other words, they are contagious.</li>
					<li> <em>Recovered/Removed</em>, meaning that the person is no longer contagious; they have either
						recovered from the disease or have died and been removed from the population. Either way, they
						are no longer <em>infected</em> or <em>susceptible</em> to infection.</li>

					Then, equations are used to determine how people in the population will move from
					<em>susceptible</em> to <em>infected</em> and from <em>infected</em> to <em>recovered/removed</em>.

				<h2 style="font:bold;font-size:18px"><strong>Exploring an SIR Model</strong></h2>
				<p style="font-size:18px;color:black">In any model, we <em> <strong> start with multiple
							assumptions:</strong></em></p>
				<div class="row">
					<section class="6u" style="width:100%;font-size:18px">

						<li><strong>Population ( N ): </strong> We assume there are a fixed number of people in the
							population. In the case of COVID-19 modeling done for national governments, the population
							of interest is likely to be the total population of the country. However, SIR models can
							also be used to predict the spread of a disease in a smaller closed community, such as
							people on a cruise ship or in a prison. </li>
						<li> <strong>Initial Infected (Infected<sub>Day = 1</sub>):</strong> The number of people
							infected with the disease on the day that the model "starts".</li>
						<li> <strong>Transmission Rate: </strong>A measure of how quickly the disease will spread. This
							is expressed as the number of susceptible people that each infected person will infect per
							day, on average. Transmission rate could be determined by factors such as:
							<ul>
								<li> The probability that a <em>susceptible </em>person who comes into contact with an
									<em>infected</em> person will themselves become <em>infected</em>.</li>
								<li>The number of other people that a given person comes into contact with on any given
									day.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>


						<li> <strong>Recovery Rate: </strong> A measure of how long people take to move from
							<em>infected</em> to <em>recovered</em>. This is expressed as the proportion of people who
							are currently <em>infected</em> who will move to the <em>recovered/removed</em> compartment
							per day.</li>



						<p> Models also include implicit assumptions. A major assumption of the SIR model is that once a
							person has recovered from the disease, they cannot catch the disease again. Of course, we
							know now that recovering from COVID-19 does not provide a person with lifelong immunity to
							reinfection in the same way that recovering from, say, measles or chicken pox does, which
							makes it problematic to model COVID-19 with a basic SIR model such as this one. However, in
							early 2020 epidemiologists assumed that recovery from COVID-19 would confer such immunity.
						</p>

						<p> Each one of the formally assumed values can dramatically influence the model. However, in
							reality, these values are not known, especially at the beginning of an epidemic. Thus,
							researchers must estimate each of the assumed values. Below is an app that illustrates a
							basic SIR model. Try changing the parameters to see how they affect the overall spread of
							the disease. Then, answer the questions to the right to check your understanding. By
							understanding this model and the calculations below, we can see why at the beginning of the
							pandemic the spread of COVID-19 was often represented as a "curve".</p>

			<h2 style="font:bold;font-size:20px"><strong>Part 2:&nbsp; How Public Policy Can Influence Model
					Assumptions</strong></h2>
		</header>
		<p> While SIR models can be insightful, you should quickly realize that the model depends heavily on the
			assumptions made by the researchers who are developing the model. What is the transmission rate when people
			are wearing masks versus when they are not wearing masks? How does social distancing help to lower the
			transmission rate? How do the two interact? The answers to questions such as these can have massive
			implications for how deadly the disease can be.</p>

		<p> Let’s take a closer look at a couple of the parameters in our simple SIR model. </p>
		<strong style="font-size:20px"> Transmission Rates</strong>

		<p> If you change the transmission rate in the graphing application above, you’ll notice that lowering the
			transmission rate by itself does not necessarily stop the spread of the disease. The true determinant of how
			many people will ultimately get the disease is the ratio between the transmission rate and the recovery
			rate. This is often referred to as the Reproducibility Number (R). This number tells us, on average, how
			many additional people one infected person will infect over the entire course of their infection. As you can
			see in the graph, if R is greater than 1—that is, if the transmission rate is greater than the recovery
			rate—then an epidemic will occur since more people are being infected than are recovering. If R is less than
			1, then the disease will die out as more people are recovering then being infected. If R is very close to 1,
			there will be a constant rate of infections</p>

		<p> The Reproducibility Number will change over the course of the epidemic; as people move from
			<em>susceptible</em> to <em>recovered/removed</em>, the number of susceptible people shrinks and each
			infected person will be able to cause fewer new infections. Thus epidemiologists often talk about
			R<sub>0</sub>, or the Reproducibility Number on day 0 when everyone in the population is still susceptible.
			You can also calculate R<sub>t</sub>, or the Reproducibility Number on day t, or the Reproducibility Number
			on day <em>t</em>. As we can see in the graph, when the transmission rate is greater than recovery rate, we
			can see that R<sub>t</sub> is initially greater than one and the number of people wh are infected every day
			increases. Then, after infections reach peak on day <em>t</em> and start to decrease, R<sub>t</sub> is less
			than 1. One of the major challenges in SIR modeling is that the transmission rate is non-constant. It is
			time-dependent and can vary drastically. </p>


		<strong style="font-size:20px"> Initial Infected </strong>
		<p>
			The initial infected parameter can also affect whether an outbreak will occur. Remember that for an epidemic
			to occur, each person who is infected must infect, on average, more than one additional person over the
			course of their infection. Let’s say the R<sub>0</sub> for a particular disease is 1.33, and at present only
			one person is infected. That person can’t infect 1 and 1/3 of a person! Each whole person is either infected
			or not, so the calculations in the SIR model are rounded to the nearest whole number. With an R<sub>0</sub>
			of 1.33, in an SIR model that person will only infect one other person (1.33 will round down to 1), who will
			also only infect one other person, and an epidemic will not occur. However, if 10 people are infected
			initially, they will infect a total of 13 people between them, who will infect a further 17 people, and the
			number of cases will grow into an epidemic. You can see this yourself using the graphing application or the
			calculations above.
		</p>
		<strong style="font-size:20px"> Looking at the variability of SIR models</strong>
		<p>
			Predicting how the COVID-19 pandemic would progress quickly proved to be an incredibly challenging task. The
			images below represent possible scenarios that the <a
				href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html"> CDC </a> suggested early
			in the pandemic based on different possible values for R<sub>0</sub>, using SIR simulations with a
			population of 100,000. You can see from these images that altering the transmission rate and recovery rate
			even slightly caused drastic changes in the predicted outcome for the pandemic. “Flattening the curve” by
			reducing the transmission rate does reduce the total number of infections, but it still leads to a majority
			of the population being infected. The number of people infected on the peak day of infections is
			dramatically lower, reducing the strain on the healthcare system, but the trade-off is that the epidemic
			lasts longer.
		</p>
		<p>It is important to note that changing the recovery rate has little effect on how long the epidemic will last
			or how many people will ultimately be infected, unlike changing the transmission rate.

		<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

		<strong style="font-size:20px"> Model Complexity and Assumptions </strong>
		<p> We must remember that the model we have been looking at is very basic. The differences between the possible
			predicted outcomes become even more apparent as researchers increase the complexity of the models by, for
			example, adding parameters to account for an incubation period for the disease, for quarantine or isolation
			measures, or for the possibility of reinfection. When there is great uncertainty around the correct numbers
			to use for the model inputs, or even around which parameters need to be included in the model, any
			predictions produced by these models will be very uncertain as well. This uncertainly prevents creating <a
				href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjid.2020.04.003">reliable projections for the course of the
				outbreak</a>, which frustrates efforts to contain outbreaks and worsens the already devastating burdens
			on the healthcare system and the economy. Careful attention must be given to the assumptions made when using
			any model, whether it be an SIR or a statistical model.
